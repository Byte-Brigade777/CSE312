IMPORTANT NOTE: The application does not work on Firefox browsers. We are not sure why, but it won't let more than one user post at a time. It was tested on Chrome, Edge, and Safari and it works successfully on all three of those.


Project Part 3 AO3
Documentation for extra feature:
The feature adds two new coloring modes for the website: dark mode and gamer mode.
Dark mode changes the coloring to an eyesight friendly color template with darker colors, similar to dark modes found elsewhere.
Gamer mode changes to an RGB color template that rotates through different colors like an RGB light on a gaming setup.

WARNING: If you are sensitive to quickly changing bright colors do not test gamer mode.

Testing procedures:
1. Navigate to https://ubsharecse.com
2. Register with an account and then login with that account
3. Click on the dark mode button at the top of the screen. The colors of the page should change to a dark mode version with mostly gray coloring.
4. Click the dark mode button again to return to light mode.
5. Click the gamer mode button to see the colors change to a shifting RGB color palette.
6. Click gamer mode again to return to light mode.
